=========================

Barry Mullan (March 2015)

## Overview

This app creates a boxplot of time in process values for Portfolio Items. The values are plotted grouped by 
Time Period (Months) and size (Preliminary Estimate). Future enhancements will allow grouping on other values.

The time in process is based on the number of days items spend from the BeginState to the EndState. Only 
items that have reached the CompletedState are included.
